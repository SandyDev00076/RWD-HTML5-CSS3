            <h1>Captain Marvel</h1>
            <p class="texttouse">
                Captain Marvel is an extraterrestrial Kree warrior who finds herself caught in the middle of an
                intergalactic battle between her people and the Skrulls. Living on Earth in 1995, she keeps having
                recurring memories of another life as U.S. Air Force pilot Carol Danvers. With help from Nick Fury,
                Captain Marvel tries to uncover the secrets of her past while harnessing her special superpowers to end
                the war with the evil Skrulls.

            <h1>Doctor Strange</h1>
            <p class="texttouse">
                Doctor Strange serves as the Sorcerer Supreme, the primary protector of Earth against magical and
                mystical threats. After a car accident severely damages his hands and hinders his ability to perform
                surgery, he searches the globe for a way to repair them and encounters the Ancient One. After becoming
                one of the old Sorcerer Supreme's students, he becomes a practitioner of both the mystical arts and the
                martial arts.

            <h1>Captain America</h1>
            <p class="texttouse">
                Captain America is the alter ego of Steve Rogers, a frail young man enhanced to the peak of human
                perfection by an experimental serum to aid the United States government's efforts in World War II. He
                remains a highly respected figure in his community which includes becoming the long-time leader of the
                Avengers. The Super-Soldier Serum enhances all of his metabolic functions and prevents the build-up of
                fatigue poisons in his muscles, giving him endurance far in excess of an ordinary human being.
